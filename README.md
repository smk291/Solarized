# Solarized Mono

Solarized Mono modifies the Sublime Text 3 Solarized color scheme so that text is rendered in just a single color (or two, depending on what/how you count). The background color is the background color of the corresponding Solarized theme. The for a foreground color.

# ...ok, why?
I realized I'd become too reliant on my editor/IDE. Autocompletion, error highlighting/underlining, and syntax highlighting had become crutches. Just as turning off spellcheck forces me to be better at spelling, using a theme like Solarized Mono makes me better -- slower, more methodical, more accurate -- at both reading and writing code.
